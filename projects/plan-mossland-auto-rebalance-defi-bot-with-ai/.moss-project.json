    "**Estimated Cost**: Estimated cost includes $50k in labor costs for a team of 5, $10k in cloud infrastructure, and $20k in external services and APIs.",
    "**Frontend**: React with Next.js to ensure server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO. The choice will also enable easy integration with the backend API.",
    "**Backend**: Node.js with Express framework due to its non-blocking I/O model which can handle concurrent connections efficiently, suitable for real-time portfolio updates.",
    "**Database**: PostgreSQL for transactional integrity and complex queries necessary for risk assessment algorithms.",
    "**Blockchain Integration**: Ethereum-based smart contracts for decentralized and transparent audit mechanisms. We will leverage DeFi protocols such as Uniswap and Aave for liquidity management.",
    "**External APIs**: Use APIs from market data providers to get real-time price updates, AI services for predictive analytics, and a third-party authentication service for secure user access.",
    "**System Architecture Diagram**: The system is designed with microservices architecture where each component (user interface, portfolio tracking, rebalancing algorithm, risk management) communicates through RESTful APIs.",
    "[ ] Task 1: Establish project repository and version control setup.",
    "[ ] Task 2: Define the initial data models for users, portfolios, and transactions in PostgreSQL.",
    "**Milestone**: Completion of foundational infrastructure setup, including CI/CD pipelines."
